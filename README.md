# chess-playground

Hello, this is my pet project for mastering frontend techonologies

It's going to be a simple chess app built as SPA. You'll be able to play chess against others on one device via a browser. After each move, the board is reverted to make it easier for the next player

Currently, I got no intentions to make it a full-stack application. That is, there won't be any server-side processing, persisted storage, etc. All the game logic will take place on the client-side

## Setup

```sh
git clone git@github.com:karpinovsky/chess-playground.git
cd chess-playground/
docker-compose up
```

## Installing libraries
```sh
docker-compose run --rm frontend /bin/sh
npm install <libraryName>
```
